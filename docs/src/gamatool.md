## Building your project

To build a project from your terminal:

- Open your terminal, like cmd, kitty, or windows terminal
- Change to your project root(The folder you created) using `cd my/project/path` on linux or powershell or `dir my/project/path` on windows.
- Run the build command `gama build`

To build the project run `gama build`, this will create a folder in `build/` and your executable application will be in that folder.

> You may not run the executable inside the build folder, as it will have errors trying to find your app files.
